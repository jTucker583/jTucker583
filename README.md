# Hi, I'm Jake.
I'm a Computer Science major at CU Boulder, with affilliations to The Cooperative Human-Robot Intelligence Lab (COHRINT) and Colorado RoboSub. I've done work related mostly to robotics, designing and building most of the software stack for Colorado RoboSub, and Android Development for an app that leverages AI to remotely pilot a drone for COHRINT, among other things.
